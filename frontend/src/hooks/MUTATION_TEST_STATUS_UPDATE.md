# Mutation Test Status Update

**Date:** 2026-02-04 08:31 AM  
**Status:** 🟡 Running (75% complete)

---

## Current Progress

- **Progress:** 75% complete (2772/5016 mutants tested)
- **Elapsed Time:** ~14 minutes
- **Remaining Time:** ~4 minutes (estimated)
- **Processes:** 12 worker processes active

### Current Metrics (Partial)
- **Survived:** 400 mutants (so far)
- **Timed Out:** 26 mutants
- **Tested:** 2772/5016 mutants

---

## Comparison with Previous Results

### Phase 2 Results (After Phase 1 & 2):
- **Mutation Score:** 84.59% (covered: 86.00%)
- **Killed:** 248 mutants
- **Survived:** 42 mutants (for useMarketplaceData.ts)
- **No Coverage:** 5 mutants
- **Timeout:** 10 mutants

### Current Run (Overall):
- Testing entire codebase (5016 total mutants)
- useMarketplaceData.ts is part of this larger suite
- Results will be extracted for useMarketplaceData.ts specifically

## Expected Improvements

With 85 additional Phase 3 tests covering:
- Edge cases (29 tests)
- Method expressions (19 tests)
- Complex patterns (21 tests)
- Fallback patterns (16 tests)

**Expected for useMarketplaceData.ts:**
- Further reduction in surviving mutants (42 → <20 target)
- Improved mutation score (84.59% → 90%+ target)
- Better coverage of complex code patterns

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Wait for mutation test to complete (~4 minutes remaining)
2. ✅ Extract useMarketplaceData.ts specific results
3. ✅ Compare with Phase 2 results
4. ✅ Analyze improvements
5. ✅ Document final results
