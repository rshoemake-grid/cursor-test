## Observations

1. **Process Stability**: All checks show process is running consistently
2. **No Crashes**: No errors or crashes detected
3. **Longer Duration**: Taking longer than expected (28+ minutes)
   - This is normal for initial test run with coverage analysis
   - Large test suite (293+ test files)
   - Coverage analysis adds significant overhead

## Next Steps

- Continue monitoring every 5 minutes
- Watch for completion indicators
- Detect any crashes immediately
- Report results when complete

## Completion Indicators to Watch For

- ✅ "Dry run completed" message
